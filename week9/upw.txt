I love the feel of UPW. They have a very clean simple but powerful theme. I love the fact that they didn¡¯t go super crazy with colors like some other t-shirt websites like Threadless.com. The most beautiful thing on the site is their grid system. A lot of the objects are made out of squares. The smallest piece is a single square and the biggest piece is a combination of 4 squares. I love that they broke up the trend with rectangular areas made up of 2 squares. Their responsive design is similar to the one of the Mountain Dew website. They are definitely keeping up to date on website trends. 
There are a lot of neat interactive elements like delays for the navigation page marker. Another thing to notice is how fast the page loads with hundreds of different images. They really did a great job of optimizing the images as well as having them load smoothly. Their pixelated style reminds me a little bit of the successful game of Minecraft. Once you click the link to the Pixel Livery, I see that the logo flashes with the mouse over. That feels a little out of place with all the simple effects and is over the top. Another thing is that their navigation text seems to be a bit small compared to the rest of the text found on the website. I see that the website was made by Full Stop. I love their simplistic design with a good amount of interactivity.
