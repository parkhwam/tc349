The first thing that stands out is that the website is simple. It¡¯s not too hard to figure out that the website was created for mobile devices. All the test and icons are big and there aren¡¯t too many interactive elements. I thought it would be better if they did a better job of continuity with the icons. Some of the have empty spaces cut out as transparent areas while some have a white background. I think a down state animation for the icons would improve the usual experience. When I click the icons, I noticed that the different parts of the website don¡¯t come back to the main mobile page. I think the site map could be improved with something like page crumbs.
Going back to the icons, I don¡¯t really see a logical in the order of the icons. I feel that the icons should be categorized alphabetically or by importance. The icons also should be centered the same way and take up the same amount of space. Some of the icons looks similar while others stand out. I see that the search only looks through 3 parts of the website. I think it should have access to the information located on the rest of the website.  There is a lack of continuity in the content and style of the footer on each page. Some of the pages switch up the order of elements on the page. The search box is the 2nd item on the Events page while it¡¯s first on the main page. The site works well but its aesthetics and usability can be improved with keeping to continuity.
