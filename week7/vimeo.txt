I like the top section of the home page. It¡¯s very colorful and has a lot of elements. What I don¡¯t like is the contrast between the top part and the rest of the page. They didn¡¯t really keep any uniformity for the backgrounds of the different sections. Other than the background though, they did a good job of keeping the same text size and font for the lower sections. They have a good mix of galleries and different number of columns in each section.
The navigation could be a little bit smoother. It feels a little laggy when the mouse hovers over the different buttons of the navigation. I think a delay and a smooth fade in would seem a lot more natural and less rigid. They do have a lot of random color throughout the page that could be limited. If anything though, they do give a feel that they are open to creativity and show that they aren¡¯t afraid to break a couple design rules. I can¡¯t say that I personally like some of their choices though.
