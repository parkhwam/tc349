The first thing that jumps out at me is the amount of origami the website uses. I would automatically assume that the company is a paper distributing company or an origami retailer. I like the fact that they keep uniformity with the site but it has nothing to do with what they really do.  I think it would confuse users that don¡¯t exactly know why they came onto the site. The purple and light blue has a good contrast against the dark gray background. The different highlights and interactivity of the elements keeps me entertained and drawn to certain parts of the website.  A lot of other diagrams and illustrations combine HTML and other animated elements.
The header seems to have a lot of space between the logo and the navigation buttons. I think it might have looked better to keep the same alignment as the content. They have a good sense of how much negative space to use. They do a good job of separating elements and grouping parts that go together. The page order makes sense and is user friendly. I love the statistics they have on the front page. If the numbers are automatically updated, the level of coding is quite impressive. 
I chose to do a two column layout since it seems to be the most common. I¡¯m used to the layout from using multiple blogging websites. It doesn¡¯t waste too much negative space since there only needs to be one divider between the two columns. It clearly shows what the main content is without losing the importance of the side elements.
