<h3>Your daily source of ranting</h3>

<p>I know we are suppose to have 4 pages but I really was interested in the one pagy layouts. I wanted to try a fixed navigation bar as well.</p>
<p>Even though the weather has gotten a bit warmer, spring is still far away. The temperature will be dropping back into the 30s starting tomorrow. Even though a lot of people are wishing for spring, I personally want to hold onto winter a little more. My reasons for disliking spring:
 <ul>
<li>Muddy gray slush. YUCK</li>
<li>Soaking rain... like today</li>
<li>The epic release of pollen</li>
</ul>
 
<p>If you don't believe me, go check out the weather professionals at <a href="http://www.weather.com">National Weather</a>.</p>
