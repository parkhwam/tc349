<h4>Note: I tried to reformat my computer after a virus and had some bootup issues today. I had to a system restore off a point from a few days ago. That's why I didn't have the card sorting pt. 2 done. I hope you won't deduct too many points. Thanks!</h4>
<h1>Foldable.me</h1>
<h2>What did I do?</h2>
<p>I analyzed the webstie of <a href="http://www.foldable.me">foldable me</a> through the process of card sorting. By breaking down the website into cards, I allowed participants to group and restructure the website in a way that made sense to them.</p>
<p>The creator of the website divided the content between the following 5 pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Create</li>
<li>About</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Contact</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Numbers and Borings stuff (Data)</h2>
With the help of 5 participants, I got various results with my 22 cards. It was suprising to see that they didn't agree as much as I thought they would. I was expecting over 50% for some of the cateogries.
<h3>Category Summary</h3>

<p>The participants seem to agree the most on the cards that go into the about page. On the flip side, the content for the create page seemed to be controversial with an agreement percentage of 28.</p>
<h3>Tree Graph</h3>

<p>There were a few obvious clusters of cards. The most obvious one was made up of price, made with cardboard, simple assembly, free shipping, and only 11.99.</p>
<h2>How I see it</h2>
<p>My choices in the card placement had an average of 35% in agreement. I was actually kind of shocked since I thought that the most of the content placement was common sense.</p>
<p>The research made it clear that somethings should definetely should stay where they are. The short film card had an agreement of 80%. The current website agrees with its placement in the home page. The price had an agreement rate of a 100% at the homepage.There was a lot of controversy with over half the cards at 20%. Overall, I think the usuability of foldable.me is fairly high. Even if it wasn't, I like how it looks!</p>
