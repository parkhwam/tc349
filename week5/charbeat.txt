I like the general feel of the website. The gradients aren¡¯t too strong or overly done. The colors that they chose blend well together but still have a good amount of contrast. The blue and the red really contradict each other and make the user focus on the different buttons and features of the website. The site¡¯s ability to record and display the statistics of the website is pretty powerful. The fact that it constantly updates without any glitches shows that there¡¯s a lot of powerful coding behind the website.
I like the fact that the illustrations are animated and give an interactive element to the website. I personally like one page designs where I can just scroll down and read everything that I want to read. The fixed bar on the top could use a navigation to make it easier for new users. The clever comment on the bottom counteracts against the problems that I mentioned earlier. I think the fixed bar could be a bit smaller in height. It really is obtrusive and blocks a good inch of the top. Overall, the design is great!
