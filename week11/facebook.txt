The first that comes to mind when I heard the word mobile website is the mobile facebook site. It can be accessed through http://m.facebook.com. The reason for my interest in this site is that they didn¡¯t trade off any aesthetics for the usability of a mobile site. I tribute a lot of the aesthetics to a lot of padding that¡¯s been readjusted from the native website. Nothing jumps out to say that there is too much or too little space. Everything is legible but doesn¡¯t take so much space that it looks amateurish. They did a good job of translating all the same icons and symbols so that the user experience is almost identical to the native website.
I really enjoy the fact that m.facebook doesn¡¯t destroy the different types of media that users upload. There is a good mix of photos and videos directly on facebook and also from 3rd party applications or websites. The coding has been structured to proper adjust and scale the media without any deformation. All the texts also look right because they kept the ration between the different elements on the page. Another challenge that the Facebook team tackled well is the never ending feed of data on the home page. The website keeps adding elements as the user scrolls lower and lower down the page. This would be impossible without a clean and intricate css layout to adjust and respond to the changing structure of the website.
