The style of Etsy is simple and minimalistic. There is only a small amount of text compared to the countless images on each of its pages. I like the fact that they didn¡¯t put a cheesy shadow drop behind the images. The blue and grey isn¡¯t too hard on the eyes and has a good enough contrast. The organization on the side tab is simple and also minimalist. I enjoy the java script background effect for the side tab.
The whole website is responsive and mobile friendly. The page is optimized to load fast even with all the images it has. I like the small bottom area for other links and copyright information. They didn¡¯t try to fit too much information so it¡¯s clear and organized. There¡¯s a good amount of padding for all the elements on the page. There¡¯s enough to distinguish where different containers are but it doesn¡¯t feel like they are completely separated. They copied the bottom navigation style for the top but that doesn¡¯t look that good in my opinion. I liked that they kept with the 2 color theme by adding the underline text decoration.
I¡¯m not a fan of the thick rectangles that they are using on the header. There is a lot of negative space for no clear reason. That part of the website looks too big so it decreases the professionalism of the whole theme. I like that the Etsy logo is the only thing that¡¯s different in color. They did a good job of picking two fonts that go well together but also have different usages. The light green they used for their prices is not very noticeable. This might be good to keep the shopper ignorant about how much they are spending. It could be a marketing strategy or a accidental choice in color.
