The general feel of the website is quite modern. There¡¯s a good use of gradients and shadow drops. The designer or developer took advantage of the different JavaScript and CSS effects. The slideshow is smooth and doesn¡¯t seem to glitch in anyway. The drop down for the navigation is smooth and loads smoothly. I personally enjoy the half second delay that¡¯s added to the drop down list.
The different pages keep uniformity in the layout of the different elements.  All the headings and subtexts follow a system instead of having a whole bunch of different CSS styles. There is a lot of space between the header and the h1. The alignment is well kept and there is a good amount of negative space. The bottom part of the website also follows a set of guidelines and the links are listed in a systematic way. The fonts in all the pages work together and there are only 2 or 3 fonts on the whole website. 
The color on the website accurately follows the branding guideline of MSU. I like the fact that they incorporated a solid background with some gradient elements in the rest of the website. I don¡¯t like how strong some of the shadow drops are. I think it would be a bit friendlier if the shadow drops were softer or smaller in size. The contrast works well but I don¡¯t see why there needs to be such a strong contrast. It brings too much focus or attention to the header.
