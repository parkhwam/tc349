Jason's site is fairly up to date in my opinion.  His navigation has a clean and simple hover effect that matches the color theme of the website. I can see some kind of a grid set up from looking at how some of the objects are aligned. He sticks to about two fonts that work well together. The fonts that he chose are both legible and visually appealing.  He has established a clean two column layout for the content of his pages. I personally think that it still looks a little messy since the two columns don¡¯t always horizontally align. I would think a visual separator or a more noticeable amount of space between the two columns would improve the organization. His posts or paragraphs are well organized into tags that the user can use to specify the content that they want to see. The JQuery or Javascript that they are using is very smooth and doesn¡¯t have any visual bugs. I think there is a little too much information in the bottom. I would perhaps add some of that content onto the main page or somewhere else.  I do admire the fact that the site is responsive and loads fine one my phone as well. I love the overall minimalist and functional design of the website.
