<h2>Panic.com Review</h2>
<p>The general feel of the website isn’t too unfriendly. The graphics are clean and the page loads well. The problem is that the website almost feels too friendly. Everything is too big and makes the user feel as if the site was treating them like a kid. The colors work together but there is no unity since there are so many colors. There doesn’t seem to be a union between the website’s color scheme and the logo’s color scheme.</p>  
<p>The graphics lose some resolution when the user hovers over them so that’s not a plus.  There doesn’t seem to be a good layout for the website. There are some spaces that feel empty and feel as if the person left it on an accident.  The logo and the site has the look style of the PayPal website but dumbed down. I love the fact that the site is fully responsive. If anything, it’s friendly to a mobile user. Since that’s the market of the company, I would say I can at least see why they did some of the things they did. Overall, everything is too big and there needs to be more uniformity.
