I love the style of the whole website. I¡¯m all for sharp vector shapes verses a whole bunch of patterns and gradients. My problem with websites that go for photo-realism is that it never looks realistic. Don¡¯t try to trick the user into thinking that the website is alive. They only put emphasis on the two main colors of red and black. The cog and the dotted lines are very industrial and both have a no B.S. feel. There aren¡¯t a lot of useless backgrounds and sections. The website is direct and gets to the point of saying what it needs to say. Some simple JavaScript for buttons and mouse hovers make the website much more interactive and fun to explore. 
I love how the navigation only becomes fixed when the user scrolls past the header. They also broke the general layout of just having a log and navigation in the header. They saved a whole section on their homepage through that choice. I love the variety of two and three column sections. There is a good balance between the images and text. The hover effect from grayscale to image is a little overused but I still get a good kick out of it. I personally like it when the footer doesn¡¯t have 5 columns of links. Their simple thank you is clever and really gets to the point. I feel like they went a little overboard with the negative space in the footer. I think they could have condensed it a little more. However, I think that part would look much better on a mobile phone.
