The development setup that I chose is fairly standard in my opinion. My browser of choice has always been Google Chrome. Not evening getting into how it runs, I just like the feel and look of Chrome better than its competitors. I really like the minimalist design and how it runs as simple as it looks. The simplicity makes it really easy to work with any type of web designing. 
After checking out some of the text editors, I ended up coming back to Dreamweaver. I guess I should want the same simplicity and minimalist feel of Chrome in the program I use but I really like Dreamweaver. It¡¯s got a lot more on the page so it¡¯s a little hard to find some stuff but it¡¯s quite useful once I got used to it. It all came down to fact that I¡¯ve been using it for the past year or so. I¡¯d rather learn some new coding than figure out how to operate a new text editor. 
I sometime use a dual monitor system when designing or coding. This allows me to maximize Dreamweaver to its full extent and also do coding and check resources on the other screen. I would definitely think about another program if I had fit two programs on a single tiny laptop screen.
